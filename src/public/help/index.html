            <h2>Quick Start Guide - tl;dr</h2>
            <hr />
            <ol>
                <li>Load the <a onClick="openWebBuzzerMod()" href="#">Jeopardy web buzzer mod</a> into your Jeopardy game. (Only supports <a onClick="openJeopardyMod()" href="#">this Jeopardy mod</a>)</li>
                <li>Either scan the QR code or copy/paste the URL into your browser to buzz in.</li>
                <li>When the host (Teal player) clicks the <code>'Unlock Buzzers'</code> button, you'll be able to buzz in.</li>
                <li>When the screen turns green and you see <code>'The buzzer is active!'</code>, click anywhere on the screen to buzz in.</li>
                <li>The API will determine who buzzed in first and update the game state automatically.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>How does the mod work?</h2>
        <p>
            This mod injects itself into the existing <a onClick="openJeopardyMod()" href="#">Jeopardy script</a>
            for Tabletop Simulator. As such, the changes it makes to the currently-running version 
            of the script are irreversible and if you wish to use the base mod, you have to reload 
            the workshop version without loading the web buzzer panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            A continuous moving average of a player's ping is calculated once they are connected to the web buzzer.
            When a question is read and the buzzer is unlocked, players are able to buzz in on the web buzzer. On
            the back end, the time the player buzzed in is calculated on the time that the buzz was received minus
            the average moving average of that player. To account for players with higher-than-average ping, a configurable
            wait time is set that the back end will wait before calculating the winner of the buzz.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2>Are there any configuration options?</h2>
        <p>
            Presently, there are no configurable options, but the following per-game configuration options will be available
            shortly:
        </p>
        <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <h3>question_time</h3>
            <code>Default: 5000 ms</code>
            <p>This option allows the host to set the maximum time allowed for buzzes for each question.</p>

            <h3>max_wait_time</h3>
            <code>Default: 2000 ms</code>
            <p>
                This option allows for a time threshold to be set for players with higher-than-average ping.
                For example, if the question_time is set to 5 seconds, and max_wait_time is set to 2 seconds,
                the total time per question will be 7 seconds. That allows players with up to 2 seconds of 
                average latency to still have a chance to buzz in and be factored into who wins.
            </p>

            <h3>buzzer_cooldown</h3>
            <code>Default: false</code>
            <p>
                Just like in the actual show, this allows hosts to enable a penalty for players that buzz in too
                early. This penalty time isn't configurable and is set to 250ms.
            </p>
